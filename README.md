# csvquery
This project is a response to the interview question I received from Data61:

> Using your preferred language, write a program that will parse the attached CSV file such that you can write the following tests:
> 
> 1) A record exists for 'Bob'
> 
> 2) The total number of records is 4
> 
> 3) Dave's phone number is '0400 001 123'
> 
> Please complete without using a library for parsing the CSV, other libraries are fine. Bring your solution and test cases to the interview where you will walk us through how you approached the problem and the code you have written. You will also be asked to make some modifications during the interview. Please bring it on your own laptop.
> 
> See attached CSV file.

The CSV file in question is [CSVfile.csv][test/CSVfile.csv].
